# Introduction-to-Neural-Networks-with-Keras
An introduction to building and training neural networks using Keras, focusing on deep learning fundamentals and model optimization techniques.

## What Are Neural Networks?
Neural networks are algorithms inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) that process data and learn patterns through training.

Input Layer: Takes input features (e.g., numerical values, images, text).

Hidden Layers: Process the data through weights and activation functions.

Output Layer: Produces the final prediction or classification.

## What is Keras?
Keras is a high-level API for building and training neural networks. It is built on top of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and provides an intuitive interface for creating deep learning models.

Key Features:

User-friendly

Modular and extensible

Integrated with TensorFlow

## Understanding Key Concepts
Activation Functions: Non-linear transformations (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, softmax) applied to neuron outputs.

Loss Functions: Measure the difference between predicted and actual values (e.g., mean_squared_error, binary_crossentropy).

Optimizers: Algorithms to adjust weights and biases during training (e.g., Adam, SGD).

Epochs and Batch Size: Define the number of training iterations and how many samples to process at a time.

## Common Use Cases
Classification (e.g., image, text, or speech)

Regression (e.g., predicting house prices)

Time series forecasting

Anomaly detection

## Why Use Keras?
Simplifies Complex Tasks: Keras abstracts much of the low-level complexity involved in deep learning.

Quick Prototyping: Ideal for beginners and fast experimentation.

Scalability: Works seamlessly with TensorFlow for large-scale machine learning tasks.
